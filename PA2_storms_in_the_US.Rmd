## Synopsis

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Data Processing

To process the data, I used the following libraries:
```{r, results = "hidden"}
suppressWarnings(library(dplyr))
```

The dataset is very large and includes a variety of columns that are not relevant to my analysis. In order to make the calculations lighter on my computer, I therefore:

- loaded the data set;
- created a subset with the relevant columns;
- removed the original data set and performed an iterative garbage collection process.

```{r, cache = TRUE}
# do_collect_garbage()
#
# This function collects garbage efficiently to free up memory
#
do_collect_garbage <- function(x) {
        Sys.sleep(1)
        invisible(gc())
        Sys.sleep(1)
        invisible(gc())
        Sys.sleep(1)
        invisible(gc())
        Sys.sleep(1)
        invisible(gc())
}

storm_data <- read.csv("Data/storm_data.csv.bz2", header = T, stringsAsFactors = T)
subset <- select(storm_data, STATE__, BGN_DATE, STATE, EVTYPE, F, MAG, FATALITIES, INJURIES, PROPDMG, PROPDMGEXP, CROPDMG, CROPDMGEXP)
rm(storm_data)
do_collect_garbage()
```

Since there are too many event types, I began to clean them up by removing those that produced no damage and are therefore irrelevant to my analysis. I then cleaned up my temporary variables and freed up some more memory.

```{r, cache = TRUE}
tmp_levels <- length(levels(subset$EVTYPE))
evtypes_dmg <- aggregate(x = (subset[, "PROPDMG"] + subset[, "CROPDMG"]), by = list(subset[, "EVTYPE"]), FUN = "sum")
irrelevant_evtypes <- filter(evtypes_dmg, x == 0) %>% select(Group.1)
subset <- filter(subset, !(EVTYPE %in% unlist(irrelevant_evtypes)))
subset <- droplevels(subset)
erased_levels <- tmp_levels - length(levels(subset$EVTYPE))
rm(evtypes_dmg)
rm(irrelevant_evtypes)
rm(tmp_levels)
do_collect_garbage()
```

This way I was able to remove `r erased_levels` levels with no cumulated damage to either health or property.
I then proceeded to tidy up the EVTYPE values. At first I:

- renamed the unknown values in a tidier way (from "?" to "UNKNOWN");
- aggregated with regular expressions some easier ones.

```{r}
subset$EVTYPE <- plyr::revalue(subset$EVTYPE, c("?"="UNKNOWN"))
```

## Results

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
